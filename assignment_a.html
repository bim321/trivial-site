    <h2>Part A – Create Basic Website</h2>

    <p id="first">Each student will create a website with several web pages that use
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language (version 5)">HTML5</abbr>, CSS3 and images. Students
        are expected
        to implement fully functional navigation between the pages. You will need to create a website to show case your
        abilities – an online portfolio of your work. The website should consist of several pages with properly
        implemented navigation between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You
        are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience. When designing and implementing
        the website, you need to keep the following requirements in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight your talents and
            abilities.
        </li>
        <li>Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or recruitment agents.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.
        </li>
        <li>Your website should work well on a <span class="recommendation">desktop computer</span> with Firefox and Chrome.
        </li>
    </ul>
