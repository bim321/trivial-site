    <h1>Brief subject description</h1>
    <img src="images/avatar.png" alt="Picture of Peter">
    <p>Online presence is a part of every day life. Web content needs to be delivered to various
        devices and needs to be available and accessible at all times. There are many technologies
        involved and these change rapidly. This subject will introduce students to the core
        technologies involved in delivering web content. Students will have an opportunity to
        build a simple web site and learn about techniques and strategies for maintaining web
        presence. The subject will also teach students how to evaluate and select web technologies
        and how to stay up to date with relevant trends and standards. The main focus will be on
        front-end, but students will be introduced to all components of the full-stack. Practical
        components will focus on the most widely deployed technologies to equip students with
        skills that are immediately applicable in the real-world and in demand by employers.
